Hi Jean this is Richard here from ToeJam studios.

I'm sorry to leave you a message like this but...your artist is totally out of fucking control. Sorry.

It's just, (gathers himself) not only did he stagger in here yesterday blind drunk and smelling like a chip shop doorway

But he took the time to abuse our engineer Ringo and then proceeded to urinate in the corner of the studio.

You might think that was all, but no. He then apparently engaged in a screaming match with his guitarist that descended into fisticuffs

During which he only went and broke our fucking sitar. (note of quiet remorse) Belonged to Ravi Shankar's brother, real pity.

Anyway, I really think you need to put him on a plane back to the states. I only didn't call the police because I know you and that you try and take chances with these whaifs and strays.

Now it's three days until Christmas and I've got a shattered studio and traumatised engineer to deal with.
