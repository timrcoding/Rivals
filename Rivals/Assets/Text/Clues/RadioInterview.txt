Radio Interview w. Luke, 08
Interviewer (I): So Luke, you've been a guest on 'Nashville Talks' a few times and I've got something to ask.
Luke (L): Yup, I'm listening.
I: You've been, how can I say this, quite vocal about your former bandmate, Josh Moore.
L: Yeah?
I: Well there was that mention in the enquirer a little while back about how you thought Powderhorn was kind of fake. Then there was that time you said an Australian shouldn't be making American music. Do you care to comment?
L: Look, I just say it how I see it.
I: (Chuckles), well I was just wonderin' what you thought about this. Obviously you're a big Lee Hazlewood fan, your album is kind of a tribute to the great man.
L: Yeah, well obviously!
I: So here's a quote from Lee from just last week, so just take a listen, 
'To me, my favourite band at the moment is definitely Powderhorn. There 'aint no point in copying me or anyone else, you've got to move on'.
What do you think of that?
(Long pause)
L: He said that?
I: He did.
L: Lee Fuckin' Hazlewood said that??
I: Luke, I...
(Crash of chair being turned over, shouting off mic)
L: Dear fucking Christ, I cannot...I cannot. Josh if you fucking hear me...anywhere, anytime man. Let's put on the gloves or out in the parking lot. It's over man.
I: Luke! Luke, just sit down.
(Cut to commercial)
