Interview with Jeff Schultz, '09
Yeah I produced this (gestures to disc on wall) now legendary record. I'm also Karen's uncle. She's a real good player, on tour with all those stars...really you should be doing a book about her!
Anyway. When I first met the band they were still pretty raw, but they had these <i>voices</i>. They were only about 18, but <i>man</i> both guys could sing.
Throw in a great drummer and steel player and it's no surprise that people still talk about them round here.
Josh was pretty quiet for most of the sessions - Luke was running the show, calling all the shots. He was Robbie Robertson to Josh's Rick Danko, if you know what I mean. These days it seems more the other way round.
I know he has this reputation now as some kind of kook, but he was always charming, polite and listened to what I had to say. He was already trying out that Southern thing. And you know what they say about people from the South...they've got manners!
The band worked real hard. They were like professionals - heads down, concentrated all the time.
And when the guys sang together, it was like there was electricity in the air. I never saw 'The Band' play live, but I figure it was pretty much like that.
We put the record out on my label, a tiny imprint, at the start of the new year.
Things were pretty slow until I put a call into my buddy Al down at KXXR. They started playing them regularly through the spring and then Rolling Stone came a knockin'.
You know, as much as it was a shame what happened to the band, look at all the music that came out of that.
I like to think I played some small role in making it happen.
