Running Club Newsletter, '09
This month we are very happy to say that the Kenilworth Trail is opening this week (August 19th). So we'll be back on our 15 mile circuit round Cedar Lake from next Saturday.
Big thanks to Jean for organising the pot luck cookoff, sad my Seinfeld 'Big Salad' didn't win, but there you go 'ey!
Finally, a massive congratulations to Josh, who celebrated his second child last week. We hope Laurie will be joining us again soon.
See you all soon! Neil.
