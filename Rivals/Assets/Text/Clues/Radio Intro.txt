Good afternoon and welcome to Different Currents, the Twin City's only weekly alternative music show.

Bit of bad news to start with I'm afraid, Luke Jackson, of legendary local band Pony Parade was involved in an automobile accident on Tuesday
down in Nashville, where he has lived for the last ten years or so. At the moment we don't know a lot about how serious things are, but it seems that Luke
is being kept in the critical care unit of St Thomas's and may be receiving life support. And you know Luke, there's a lot of love here for everything you've
done and we're all rooting that you pull through. I imagine that Josh Moore his former bandmate will be feeling the same.
So, on to the show. Let's start with a bit of the new arcade fire...
