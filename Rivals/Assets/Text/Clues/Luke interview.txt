Interview with Lucy, Luke is energized and self confident, with a spark of mischief in his eye. He is talking sparkily and with bite.

You know a lot of people think that I must hate Luke, ye know, for breaking up the band and shitting on us for not being 'country' enough, whatever that means.

I know he likes to pretend that I'm like Robbie Robertson to his Levon Helm, you know, leaching off his precious southern energy. But very few people know what it's all about with us.

Thing is, when we were in Pony Parade together, we were great mates, but Luke was like a dad to the band. He was always telling everyone what to do. 

But I didn't want a dad! I've got a dad, he lives on Selby, five minutes from me and Laurie. 

I didn't want to feel like a Kid in the middle of a bunch of adults. And when it all ended, I said to myself that wouldn't happen again. 

So when we were touring Europe in 2001 and Ben starts getting like, "I'm disappointed...you're not doing good enough", I was like 'alright mate', you going to tell me when to go to bed now? 

I thought about it a lot when we had Gracie, a month before Luke's mum died. You know, how about pretending to be a parent is all about telling people what to do. 

But actually 'being' one is very different.

We've just finished rehearsing for our first headline tour, heading off in 3 days. 

And you know, it feels like a group of adults for the first time. Phenomenal players, just getting on with things, proper grownups. Feels good.
