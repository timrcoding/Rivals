Email to David Isaacs, Penguin Books
Dear David,
Thanks very much for agreeing to help me with ordering my project.
As I explained, it has been a significant challenge ordering the book, particularly in light of recent events.
Obviously you have the initial resources, but if you need some help or orienting, please consult my website lbramley.co.uk, which contains a wealth of extra bits and pieces.
Kind regards,
Lucy
