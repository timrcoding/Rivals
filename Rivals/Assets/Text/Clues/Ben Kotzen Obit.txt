Obituary of Ben Kotzen
Ben Kotzen, a celebrated local musician, has passed away on May 12th at the age of 42 
Ben, the child of South African Jewish emigres, was a child polymath who excelled in both sports and studies at Wayzata High School.
An athletics scholar at Augsburg, he decided to leave college to pursue his love of music. A versatile multi-instrumentalist, he quickly made his name as a sideman par-excellence.
He is most well known for his role in Powderhorn, helping shape their technicolor, organ and synth driven sound during the making of Chauncey, as depicted in the documentary 'I like to watch'.
In recent years, he struggled with both ill health and his own diminishing powers on the instruments he loved so much.
His mother Rosa says, "Ben could have been anything he wanted and what he wanted was to inspire people and bring them joy. He will be sorely missed by the thousands whose lives he touched with his music".
Ben is survived by his son, Aaron.
