Phone call

CONTEXT: Lucy (now mid 30s), who is now writing a book on the relationship between the 2 main characters, Josh and Luke has heard that Luke has been involved in a serious
car accident. Josh has been estranged from Luke for many years.

Lucy: Hi Josh,how are you?

(Josh sounds a little bleary and completely wrung out)

Josh: Hi Lucy. Not so good mate. Laurie and I have just got back from Nashville to see Luke. He's...totally out of it. Doctors say it could go over either way.

Lucy: I'm so sorry

Josh: Look Luce, (sounds pained, takes a beat) I've been thinking about this a bit...this book you've been writing on me and Luke. I want you to finish it, I really do. 
But...I don't think I can give you any more. It's just taken too much out of me and with this...it's just too much. I hope you've got enough and that you can figure it all out.

(pregnant pause)

Josh: One more thing. Please be fair on Luke. I know what people think of him, but I owe him everything. I hope that people realize it wasn't always like this. We were friends.

Lucy: OK Josh I understand

Josh: Thanks

(End of convo)
