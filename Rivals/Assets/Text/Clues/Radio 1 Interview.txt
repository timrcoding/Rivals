Lucy: It Saturday 28th june, I'm Lucy Bramley, welcome to Glastonbury festival 1998, live on London radio.
I'm in a muddy field just off by the other stage with Julian Deane of Toploader. Jules, how are you doing?

Julian: I'm very well thanks!

Lucy: A lot of people are talking about Toploader as the next big thing. Think you'll be up there next year?

Julian: Oh yeah definitely.

Lucy: We've just seen Luke Jackson come off stage. He had a big hit right at the start of the year with 'Losing Sleep'. What did you think?

Julian: I thought it was alright.

Lucy: (breezily) Just alright? Anything else?

Julian: Well, I think that he probably owes The White Stripes a royalty cheque or two. 
Nick Cave is playing here tomorrow as well. Hope he doesn't hear about him!

Lucy: Alright Julian, I'll let you go. Toploader's self-titled record is out now on Far Canal records. Back to you guys in the studio.

Studio: Well sounds like Jules just threw Luke Jackson into said canal, now, here's the weather.
