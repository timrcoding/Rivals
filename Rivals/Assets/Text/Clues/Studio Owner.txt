Hi Jean this is Richard here from ToeJam studios.

I'm sorry to leave you a message like this but your artist is totally out of fucking control. Sorry.

It's just, so (gathers himself) not only did he stagger in here yesterday blind drunk and smelling like a chip shop doorway

But he took the time to abuse our engineer Ringo and proceeded to urinate in the corner of the studio.

You might think that was all, but no. He then apparently engaged in a screaming match with his guitarist that descended into fisticuffs

During which he only went and broke our fucking sitar.
