AV Club guide to Alt-Country
Powderhorn have over the past decade carved out a reputation as one of the most versatile and popular groups in alt-country.
Led by Josh Moore, Powderhorn came about in the wake of the bitter dissolution of cult favorite Pony Parade.
Although initially playing more traditional country/alternative rock, their sound quickly shifted to take in more contemporary sonic palettes.
A live favourite, Powderhorn are noted for their deep atmospheres and instrumental variety.
Essential choices: 
Alfa Romeo, 2002
Their much loved record 'art' record, which led to them parting ways with Barista records. A collection of shimmering, meditative songs embracing artists as diverse as Jim O'Rourke and Radiohead.
Isle Royale, 2008
Their most recent offering, full of majestic, classic pop music and rich in Beach Boys harmonies and technicolor keyboards.
