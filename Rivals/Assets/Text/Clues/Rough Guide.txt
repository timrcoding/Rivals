Honestly, of the four PH records, my favourite are number two and number four. 
The former is just gorgeous, beautiful songs like 'Waylaid', 'Let It Go' (melt into the waves), 'Boredom'. It's like frickin Radiohead, so 2002.
The latter is just really great upbeat pop - keys, beach boys harmonies, synths, keening vocals. Feel like Josh never sounded better. Feel like it's the sound of this summer. Going to be massive.
Jackson has completely lost it though.
