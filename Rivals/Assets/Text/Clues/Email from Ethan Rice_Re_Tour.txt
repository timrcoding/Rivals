Email from Ethan Rice, '09
Dear Lucy, thanks for reaching out. I actually live next door to Karen and see her when she's not touring with Bonnie. Happy to help.
I was a friend of Luke and Josh in high school and after, when Utah Honey got <i>that</i> review in Rolling Stone in May, saying they were the best young band in America.
Luke got it into his head that the band needed to start touring right away - like the following month. They needed someone to organise the tour and asked me, although I had no experience.
We were due to play in St Paul, Milwaukee, Duluth and Sioux City and lots of other midwest dives, with bad scheduling, that meant sometimes we drove through the night and the next day to reach the venue just in time.
So, the shows were always terrible and the guys were getting in a worse mood every day. Eric our steel player was particularly upset.
Finally things came to a head in Grand Marie, right on the boundary waters. Luke thought that a guy in the crowd was looking at Karen funny and leapt off the stage to tackle this guy.
So this guy and his buddies come charging at the whole band. We had to leave all our gear and run for the van, like that Almost Famous movie, but a lot less fun!
It was brutal, Luke got his nose busted up badly and I think broke a few ribs. The day after he went missing.
We were worried sick all the way back home. In the end Luke sent Josh a note saying that he was out and the band was over.
Personally, I think he felt guilty and sick with remorse but could never admit it. Luke wasn't really the same after that.
Hope the book goes well.

Best, Ethan
