Email: St Thomas's Hospital, '10
Dear Josh, you asked us to keep you up to date with Luke's progress and we are happy to tell you that your friend has been discharged from the hospital.
He has suffered serious, but not life changing injuries and will be walking on crutches for at least six months.
I would personally suggest (if it is my place), giving him a little time to recover before visiting.
However, he spoke of you very warmly and I think he will greatly appreciate your company.
Kind regards, Rodney Lester M.D
