Memo: Intruder Records
Guys, we have a problem with Luke. As you know, his record is not moving anything at all.
We can't get it on radio because its too country and we can't get it on country because, well, it's Luke.
I mean, what the hell is this? It's like acoustic guitar, pedal steel, moaning about a girl, where's the volume?
Since that deal at the Opry, he's been radioactive.
I for one feel that the artist we signed is not the artist we have today. I thought we were getting The White Stripes and instead we're pushing Johnny Cash.
It's April and I feel that this has gone on way too long. Let's get this sorted out quickly, by the end of the month.
If you have any objections, please let me know. Otherwise, I think we need ourselves a new bluesman. 
Right, I'm off to Detroit to find the next Von Bondies
Best, Rob.
