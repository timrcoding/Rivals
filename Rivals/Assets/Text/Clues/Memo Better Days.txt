Memo: Intruder Records, 02
Guys, we have a problem with Luke. As you know, Better Days is not moving anything at all.
We can't get it on radio because its too country and we can't get it on country because, well, it's Luke.
Since that deal at the Opry and he's been radioactive, no-one wants to touch him live.
I for one feel that the artist we signed is not the artist we have today. I thought we were getting garage rock and instead we're pushing Lee Fucking Hazlewood.
It's April and I feel that this has gone on way too long. Let's get this sorted out quickly, by the end of the month.
If you have any objections, please let me know. Otherwise, I think we need ourselves a new bluesman. 
Right, I'm off to detroit to find the next Von Bondies
Best, Rob.
