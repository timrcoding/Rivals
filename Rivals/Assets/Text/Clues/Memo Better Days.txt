Memo: Intruder Records
Guys, we have a problem with Luke. As you know, his record is not moving anything at all.
We can't get it on radio because its too country and we can't get it on country because, well, it's Luke.
Also, since that deal at the Opry, he's been radioactive.
I mean, what the hell is this record anyway? It's all acoustic guitar, pedal steel, where's the volume?
And who the hell is this Susannah? Isn't that the girl we had interning a few months back? Anyone have something to tell me?
I for one feel that the artist we signed is not the artist we have today. I thought we were getting The White Stripes and instead we're pushing Johnny Cash.
It's April and I feel that this has gone on way too long. Let's get this sorted out quickly, by the end of the month.
If you have any objections, please let me know. Otherwise, I think we need ourselves a new bluesman. 
Ok, I'm off to Detroit to find the next Von Bondies. Apparently you can just find them lying out on the street.
Best, Rob.
