Josh: Diary Entry 98
Ben's joining the band. I'm so excited. I honestly hadn't stopped thinking about this guy since I saw Bottle Rocket play at First & Seventh last month.
Jesus, what a player. Like some crazy Nils Lofgren picking shit that I haven't seen before. Then he got on the organ and I thought...this is what we could be.
Turns out that beer last night convinced him, so he's moving his stuff to our practice space. It's been two months since Luke put out his record and I've been really struggling with the feeling he's pulling away from us.
His new stuff is honestly, incredible. Kinda scary. I'm going to need some allies if we're going to war. Think I've found my first one.
