Rivals In Arms: Lucy Bramley, '05
There has always been a tension in American music as whether to push forward into bold and brilliant unknowns or to look back, for the pure pleasure of nostalgia.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in the alt-country scene, where some bands have chosen to embrace ever more traditional instruments and subject matter, while others have moved towards more advanced, post-Radiohead, style sound sculpture.
In particular the relationship between two of its key players - Josh Moore and Luke Jackson - provides a fascinating encapsulation of this dichotomy.
The former bandmates exist in radically different sonic and critical spheres. Powderhorn's progressive tendencies are regularly lauded by hipster magazines, even as they draw further into the world of indie-rock.
Meanwhile, Jackson has found an uneasy home for his musical love letters within in the country firmament, who seem ready to kick him out at a moment's notice.
Moreover, the two artists appear to draw great creativity and motivation from their fabled rivalry, to the point releasing records neck and neck for the past few release cycles.
Three years ago, Powderhorn put out their breakthrough record, Alfa Romeo. Luke shortly after released 'Better Days'. One got a bigger deal, the other got dropped.
This year, Powderhorn put out the ultra-modern Nothing is Forever, with Luke releasing his rich and retro effort shortly after.
No one seems to know how this creative artillery battle is going to end up, but we should all take notice.
