Hi Rob,
So...Luke showed up at my house yesterday. It was my kid Casey's 5th birthday, so there were like kids and parents everywhere and I was doing the BBQ when Laurie pulled me aside and told me that Josh was sitting in his chevy in the drive.
It was a bit scary at first, particularly after that time he challenged me to a fight in August. but I went out. He was just sitting there, staring straight ahead at the steering wheel. At first I thought he was angry, but actually he seemed kinda confused, like he didn't know where he was.
I didn't want him to come inside, with the kids and all so I just stood stiffly by the car window in the 90 degree weather in my chef's apron, wondering what to do. His speech was badly slurred and there was a mark on his neck, like he'd had surgery.
I couldn't make much sense of it. I think he said that he was in town for family reasons, I guessed because of Julia. He also said he'd heard I was doing real well. I said things were OK, but just that.
Then he sunk his head down onto the wheel for like 5 seconds, sucked in a deep breath, picked it up, put the truck into gear and drove off. I saw him miss the stop sign at the end of the road.
I'm pretty worried right now to tell you the truth. Have you spoken to him recently. What do you think?
Best, Josh
