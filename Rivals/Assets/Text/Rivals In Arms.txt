Rivals: Barney Sheffield, '05
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that any self-respecting rocker will be in want of a rival. 
Rivalries are fascinating and perhaps the most intriguing in music is simmering away currently within the alt-country scene.
Former bandmates Josh Moore (of Powderhorn) and Luke Jackson - both fabulously talented musicians, have been releasing records neck and neck for the past few release cycles.
Three years ago, Powderhorn put out their breakthrough record, Alfa Romeo. Luke shortly after put out 'Better Days'. One got a bigger deal, the other got dropped.
This year, Powderhorn put out Nothing is Forever on the first day of the year, with Luke releasing his wildly titled effort a month after.
Not many people seem to notice, but these two are pushing each other to greater heights (or depths) and we should all take notice.
